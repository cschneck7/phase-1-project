Welcome to my Data-Science Phase 1 project for Flatiron Academy!

It is a market analysis on films to help an imaginary client at Microsoft, whom is interested in adventuring into the film industry after seeing other big companies success. This projects focus is to analyze a movie review database and help microsoft make an educated decision on the direction they should take to be succesffull in the industry of film making. I'll be utilizing basic statistical analysis and visualizations to give three recomendations. These will be a part of a five minute non-technical presentation given to a Microsoft stakeholder role being played by one of Flatiron's instructors. A jupyter notebook will also be utilized to explain my process on the back end to achieve these results.
