Welcome to my Data-Science Phase 1 project for Flatiron Academy!

It is a market analysis on films to help an imaginary client at Microsoft, whom is interested in adventuring into the film industry after seeing other big companies success. This projects focus is to analyze a movie review database and help microsoft make an educated decision on the direction they should take to be succesffull in the industry of film making. I'll be utilizing basic statistical analysis and visualizations to give three recomendations. These will be a part of a five to ten minute non-technical presentation given to a Microsoft stakeholder role being played by one of Flatiron's instructors. A jupyter notebook will also be utilized to explain my process on the back end to achieve these results.

The results of this analysis was the suggestion of three different genre pairings. The Three pairings are listed below:

1.Sci-Fi and and Thriller
2.Sci-Fi and Adventure - Blockbuster
3.Animation and Action - Blockbuster

I came to these suggestions by analyzing the availabe monetary data. I chose to concentrate on monetary data because I feel like the financials are most important to keep the studio running and able to work on more projects. Therefore using the gross revenue and production budget data available in the datasets provided I was able to estimate the marketing costs and adjusted gross revenue that the film studio will actually realize. These figures were found on a website Stephen Follows in the two articles linked below.

It was found from these articles that the film studio only actually realizes 53% and 41% of the films Domestic and International Gross Revenues respectively. It was also estimated that each film incurred a marketing costs of 81% of production budget if it's production budget was greater than $100 million, and a marketing cost of 100% to 120% of production budget if the production budget was between $30 and $100 million. Using these factors I was able to determine what revenue a film needed to reach in order to be profitable. Using this figure I analyzed genre pairing success rates, Percentage on Investment (POI) and the correlation between production budget and POI. The three suggestions were then decided using these three metrics.
